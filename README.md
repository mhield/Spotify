Hey, this is my python script designed to take user inputted text and generate a song of related Spotify songs.

I used the pyspotify python wrapper for the Spotify API libspotify.

User login information needs to be updated in the code and a copy of your Spotify dev API key (https://devaccount.spotify.com/my-account/keys/) need to exist in your run dir to ensure proper execution.
